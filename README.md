# ckedit-fullpage

Originally based on CKEditor but the odd handing of sepcial non breaking space characters proved to be frustrating. So tinyMCE is being used in it's place. TinyMCE also seems to be better equipped to handle things like tables and other formating functions.
In additon to being an editor there is also a live PDF frame, that displays the current document in a frame rendered as a pdf.

## Setup

Run `npm install` and then run `gulp get-libs`
this installs all dependancies.
